          <h2>The boarding school, a prison... of good memories</h2>

          <p class="intro-article">When I was younger, I often had problems with my parents and in high school they ended up putting me in boarding school. But this punishment, which at the time scared me so much, turned out to be a really beneficial step in my life. In this article, I will explain why...</p>

          <h3 class="one-line-title">All in the same boat</h3>

          
          <p>I stayed in boarding school for my entire high school years. At first it's scary, you see boarding school as a prison. Most kids are afraid to go there because they are cut off from their family domain, from their comfort. If you have a problem, there is no one around to help you. That's what I thought, but like many I was wrong. I didn't take into account one thing: other students are also in the boarding school, and we are all in the same boat.</p>

          <p>Kids my age, who were all different and who were not there for the same reasons of course, but who had to live the same daily life. And when you understand that, you create bonds with people. We thought, "We're all stuck here, so we might as well have a good time together!" </p>

          <p>I think back to the movie nights we would improvise while rearranging our rooms. I remember the meals we used to make by cooking pasta in kettles or the soccer tournaments we organized in the gym where everyone saw each other at the world cup. All those moments we spent during those 3 years left me with unforgettable memories.

          <h3>A creative environment</h3>

          <p>In addition to having a great time, the internship helped me develop my creative mind and passions. The essence of creativity is the inspirations of everyday life. Especially since from a practical point of view, staying at the school all week saves time. You don't have to walk to class, except for a few feet.</p>

          <p>My passion has always been videography, so I decided to take advantage of this and create a creative routine. In the morning, I would wake up at 4:40 am and after quietly making coffee, I would edit video until about 7 am. I remember that sometimes when the hall monitor would come by the rooms to wake everyone up, he would ask me if I had slept. It made me laugh a lot.</p>

          <p>I would also lock myself in a small room in the boarding school to write scripts that were sometimes hundreds of lines long. I wasn't always alone, a friend who liked the same things as me would help me write, or just give me ideas.</p>

          <p>From a human and artistic point of view, the boarding school was a key place in my transition to adulthood. It also allowed me to discover musical artists such as Nepal, who also had a great impact on my life and my vision of things.</p>
